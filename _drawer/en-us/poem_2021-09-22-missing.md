Is that all?  
What did we forget?  
We must have forgotten something. We'll remember only later.  
Still, I'm missing something.  
If we don't remember it's certainly not important.  
Still, I'm not satisfied.

Where is it?  
When did we last see it?  
It must have disappeared along the way. Maybe we'll find it later.  
Even so, I worry.  
If it doesn't come back, it probably doesn't want to come back.  
Even so, I miss it.

Who's to blame?  
How did we let it disappear like that?  
What's done is done. We can’t do anything about it.  
However, I am waiting.  
Either way, there’s nothing to be done.  
However, I will not give up.

Does it matter?  
What reason do we have to keep looking?  
There’s nothing to remember. We didn’t forget anything.  
That’s why, I must find it.  
It's not about you.  
That's why, I'm missing.
