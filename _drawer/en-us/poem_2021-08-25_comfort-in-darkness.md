Up to now I craved it all, and now I must live a life.  
At least there is what there is, and it's not just for myself.  
I always found my own way and my own dream to look for,  
or felt meaningful somehow, I never doubted my sight.  
There is comfort in darkness, to look but never to see,  
until I'll covet again, and eyes will open once more.
