Regret. Regret.  
Confess you feel nothing and tell yourself you've no regrets.  
You've taught yourself so long ago to avoid pretty nets.  
Be aware of the threats and beware those that play your mind's frets.

Accept your silence. Safe and silent.  
It was nothing less, It was nothing more than that.  
It must have... unless... there is something more than that.  
It's been so long since you dropped your defence for... that.

Refrain. You know the pain.  
Get too close and you'll burn, your love won't be returned, but get stolen.  
That's the price that you pay for not getting away and for hoping.  
Better off trap yourself beneath a thousand miles of earth to hide you're broken.

Then regrets. Just regrets.  
Your feelings stolen by the pain until nothing remains...  
Nothing but silence.

Abide. Have pride!  
There's no shame getting hurt, I got what I deserved and survived!  
I survived what I felt even though it compelled me to die!  
It was scolding and loud... but if I'm so damn proud... why do I hide?

Give in. Reach in.  
If you love who you are you should not regret who that you've been.  
Once you've felt you can't hide from yourself you just choose what to see.  
I can't be not myself, I can change and I want to be free!

Come out... Reach out!  
Releasing myself from my prison of earth - I'm allowed!  
I don't know what's the cost of my years being lost but I'm found!  
Then the light burns my skin and I breath deep within - everything is loud!

And the sun sets. I watch the sunsets.  
I get lost in the rain until nothing remains...  
Nothing but hope, options, love, braveness, faith, taking chances and bets.  
No regrets. No regrets!
