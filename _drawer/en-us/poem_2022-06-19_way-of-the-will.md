During my service I took a course, it wasn't very good but the people were nice, when we were asked to share a hobby I decided to share some kind of a short philosophical article, not quite a poem but not quite a story wither.  
I hope you'll like it :)

There is nothing that stands in the way of the will. Right?  
...Right?  
...what if not?  
So what if not?  
So... so maybe it doesn't matter willingly or not.  
There is no law that says our will matters to the world. The earth and the sky do not know what we want, the sea and the wind roar and rage despite all our wills and objections.  
All we have is ourselves, we are the only subjects of our wills. Right?  
Or perhaps even that is beyond our control?  
The society we live in - it has its own will, and it comes before mine.  
We are captives to society's will, so even on ourselves - our wills have no freedom of influence.  
But... nothing stands in the way of the will! Right?!  
If we will it, we can change society!  
A new society that is built from the vision of our wills, a society in which we will live as we will!  
A society where truly nothing stands in the way of the will!  
And after society, we'll capture the wind, boil the sea, tear down the sky and abandon the earth!  
Nothing stands in the way of desire!

No.  
We don't want to give in to the will. We stand in the way of the will.  
Will is a wild horse, in our reining hands.  
With the wave of our hands, the will will destroy a world - or create a world.  
Will without hands to fulfill it - is just a dream.  
So - is there anything that stands in the way of the will?  
The truth is that the choice is in our hands.
