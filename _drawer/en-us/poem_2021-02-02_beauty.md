When I was in the army, I set up an open forum where anyone (mostly me) could post personal works, stories, poetry — and anything in between.
This forum was called "the drawer".

At the beginning of the "Drawer" even though there were quite a few people who joined (85!) not many people posted. In my opinion, this reluctance stemmed from the feeling that they needed to present high-quality work; otherwise, it wouldn’t meet the required standard.

I felt it was a shame because every creation, even those crafted quickly with minimal effort - and especially works that are still in progress and not completed yet - are the ones that are most fun to share.

That’s why I posted a poem, hoping it would encourage people to share their beauty with the world.
