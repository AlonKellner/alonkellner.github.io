In the heart of the desert, there is a dune larger than all the others, towering above them and competing with the heights of the mountains.  
It takes a whole day to climb to the top of the dune, when the adventurer reached the very top of the dune he could see a great distance, He even saw a glimpse of the sea peeking over the horizon when suddenly he felt something dripping on his head.

Looking up, he saw no clouds, while he felt sand accumulating and covering his forehead.  
He took a step to the side and shook the sand off, only then was he able to see it, a trickle of sand falling from the sky, the thickness of a hair and the sand in it as fine as flour.  
The sand landed right on top of the dune and formed a small pile on top of it.  
Then the adventurer noticed that the pile was growing until it spread and the sand fell to the sides and became part of the dune.  
Finally the adventurer understood - the pile is the dune.

"So my secret is revealed again" said an echoing voice.  
The frightened adventurer lay down and replied "The secret of the dune was not kept, sooner or later someone would have found out how it was formed."  
"I'm not the dune." said the voice.  
The adventurer raised his head, “If not the dune, then what are you?"  
"I am The Time."  
The adventurer laughed aloud, "And this is the secret of time? A tiny trickle of sand?"  
"Of course," replied Time, "with my help a trickle of sand can become an entire desert."  
The adventurer stood up and looked around in astonishment.  
"All this desert came from this little trickle?"  
"Not only the desert — all the sand in the world."

The adventurer's heart raced, he was filled with the excitement of childlike wonder.  
"Where does all this sand come from?"  
"The sand comes from the other world, where they see me backwards from your world."  
"The other world?! Backwards?! Does time go backwards there?"  
"In the other world they don't know when time moves backwards, for them it is your time that flows backwards."  
"So there's a desert there too, only it's emptying over time?"  
"It empties into your desert when you're at the bottom, when they're at the bottom your desert is the one that empties."  
"Bottom? Bottom of what?"  
"The bottom of the hourglass of course. Both worlds are like one big hourglass, when I flip it the sand flow reverses and I advance with the world at the bottom."

The adventurer pondered for a few minutes, finally asking "How long will it take for the desert in the other world to empty?"  
"It will happen in many years, long after your lifetime."  
"Have you ever seen him empty?"  
Time paused for a few moments, "I fear that the flow might cease. I've never let a desert run out, I always flip the hourglass just before the last grain drops.  
"How many times have you flipped the worlds?"  
"Many times, more than you can count, more than the number of grains of sand in the desert."  
"Then why do you keep going? What's interesting about seeing the same thing over and over again?"  
"The sand is like dice, every time you throw it - it falls in a different way and in a different place, so every time I flipped the hourglass the world was created differently, The desert was changed, the skies were shifted, there were creatures you would never imagine, it was fascinating to see what could happen. But I've seen too many worlds, I've thrown the sand too many times, I've witnessed every grain fall in so many ways and so many places that it's hard for me to find new worlds.  
Even your world as it is, I have already seen countless times, even our conversation now I have already discussed with you in every conceivable way.  
I still hope that one day a grain will surprise me and fall differently, then I will see a new world."

"So you're just like me! I also seek new worlds, that's the essence of adventure! When was the last time you saw a new world?"  
Time fell silent. The adventurer asked again with no answer, the trickle of sand continued to fall behind him ever gently and ever eternal.  
Extending his hand, the adventurer caught a handful of sand from the stream and let it fall, except for one single grain.  
He looked to the sky, "I'll take this grain as my keepsake, I'll find a worthy place for it one day, A place where your grains of sand have never seen before and finally - you will see another new world."  
With the grain in his hand, the adventurer set out to find a special place, where he could take The Time for a new adventure.
