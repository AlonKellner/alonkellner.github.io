I am growing as a person.  
We all are, all of the time actually, but sometimes we put ourselves in a place where we can grow faster.  
That is why I'm doing this, dedicating a whole year of my life to create a portfolio.

Many are surprised at the concept, why skip a year in your life for projects and research?  
My portfolio year is similar to taking a seminar or working on a thesis, it's not a waste - it's an investment.

The most probable profit is personal growth, but if opportunities will come through doing this publicly - that will be a great bonus :)

I wrote more thoughts about growth in another post: [Deeper into the Portfolio](../portfolio-deeper#a-philosophy-of-personal-growth).

## Define "Portfolio"

Well, you're looking at it! This website is my portfolio, or at least the beginning of it.

Most people might know portfolios as a concept from the entertainment or the arts and crafts industries, when you go to an interview or an audition your portfolio comes along your resume, if a resume is a description of your skills - a portfolio is a **proof** of them.

I wrote more about the importance of proof in another post: [Deeper into the Portfolio](../portfolio-deeper#the-professionals-obligation-of-proof).

This portfolio is very similar, but I am not a painter that can show her painting, I am an Engineer and a Researcher, so my portfolio will consist of Engineering Projects and Research Papers.

I decided to dedicate at least on whole year to working on a portfolio, I call it My Portfolio Year.  
My portfolio year starts now - the 01st of August, 2024 - and ends in exactly one year from now - the 01st of August, 2025.

I have set myself a goal to achieve until the end of this year:

> GOAL: **Between 5 and 10 Successful Projects and Papers** .

Where "Successful" means 3 things:

1. It **demonstrates a skill** of mine
2. It was a **collaboration**
3. It received **community recognition**

I elaborate about these criteria in another post: [Deeper into the Portfolio](../portfolio-deeper#my-success-criteria).

## So, What's the Plan?

In the next six months I want to finish the majority of the technical work of 5 projects, and dedicate the last six months to refinement and publication of those 5.  
If I'll have any spare time - I will try to work on some backup projects, in case one of those 5 fails to meet my success criteria.

I cannot reveal all of the details of the 5 projects I have planned just yet, but here is a short description of each one of them:

1. [**WaloViz**](https://waloviz.com) - An open-source python package of a Jupyter notebook audio player with a spectrogram built-in. **WaloViz is out NOW!** Read [my blog post about it](../waloviz-out) :)
2. **CHFSto** - Not live yet. An open-source python package that will allow you to use your favorite libraries (`os`, `pathlib`, `shutil`, `requests`, `pandas` and more) with any url scheme (`file`, `http`\\`https` or `s3` and more). More updates soon.
3. **Number Theory paper** - I proved some nice properties about sets of reciprocal numbers that add up to whole numbers, I will formalize them and publish them in a paper. More details soon.
4. **Botanical Dataset** - A long story led me to start building an automated pipeline for creating a center aligned images dataset, of three main categories: Eggs, Butterflies and Molluscs.
5. **E2E Multi-Speaker Identification with Weak labels** - This is a concept which was part of a project I worked on, it proved to be promising, I plan to reproduce the concept on multiple models and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

These are the projects which I feel confident about, other projects which I plan to try are more risky and less mature, but stay tuned and I might share my thoughts about them along the way :)

If any of these interest you, contact me! It might be an opportunity for a wonderful collaboration.  
Either send me an email or DM me at any of my social platforms.

## This is it.

Now - My Portfolio Year starts.  
My success depends on me alone, and still - wish me luck :)

I will post regular updates in this blog, as well as major updates through social media, make sure to follow me if you're interested.

If you have any thoughts you would like to share with me - please do! You can leave a comment below, email me or DM me at any of my social platforms, it would be my pleasure to talk!

Thank you for starting this journey with me :)
